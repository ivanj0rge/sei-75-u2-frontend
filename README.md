Description:

Muay Thai AMS (Automatic Management System) is a cutting-edge Dojo Management Web App, meticulously crafted during the sixth week of the course. This solo project leverages the MEVN (MongoDB, Express.js, Vue.js, Node.js) infrastructure, offering a comprehensive solution for tracking student attendance, managing rankings, and monitoring progress in martial arts dojos. The application is deployed on Netlify, providing a seamless and user-friendly experience for dojo management.
